# Pirate portofolio
Quick hack portofolio where I try to remember how to use bootstrap and material after using only tailwind for a while

## Local Development

1. install dependencies with yarn (or npm):

```bash
yarn install
```

2. start local dev server:

```bash
yarn dev
```

3. your default browser should automatically open and show the url: http://localhost:3000/

```

2. build

```bash
yarn build
```
